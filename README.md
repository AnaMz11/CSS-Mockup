During last saturday's warm up exercise we built out the html for our blog that had this mockup:


# Activity

## Create This Mockup

- Using what you learned about CSS, style the HTML warmup from yesterday so it looks like the mockup.

## Hungry For More?

1. Create/style the About page mentioned in the Stretch section of the HTML lab.
2. Style the site further to make it look more professional (e.g. style the navigation and footer links differently)!
3. If you didn't do the doggie mockup last time, do it now! If you did do the HTML mockup for it, but didn't get to the CSS, do it now!
